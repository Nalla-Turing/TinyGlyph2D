# TinyGlyph2D

A lightweight, high-performance 2D rendering engine built from scratch using **OpenGL 3.3 Core** and **C**. Designed to be modular, extensible, and educational for those who want to learn how graphics systems work under the hood.

---

## 📖 Description

This project is a collaborative effort to develop a low-level rendering library that can be used as a foundational layer for 2D game engines or graphical applications. We’re focusing on the **core principles of real-time rendering**, avoiding unnecessary abstractions to give users complete control and understanding.

Key focuses include:

- Minimal dependencies (only GLFW + GLAD)
- OpenGL 3.3 Core compliance
- Modular and reusable API design
- Educational codebase with clear documentation
